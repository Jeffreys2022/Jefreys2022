project descripion

Easton is a beautiful place and we need to keep it clean in order to keep it beautiful. Garbage is rampant and we need to help fix it because it will help clean and make the environment more fun and happy to live in. It helps animals stay safe, it cleans the environment and we stay healthy. Another reason to help clean it is because nobody wants to live in a place filled with garbage it, cleaning the garbage will make camping and overall living more of a joy. Help clean the garbage itdoesn't take much of your time and it will benifit everyone that stays there or moves here.
